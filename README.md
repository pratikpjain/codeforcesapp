# Hello Friends, 
### I have created a simple android application named <b>CFProfile</b>.
### This app simply takes Codeforces 'Handle' as a input and displays all the profile details with submissions etc.
### You can have a quick look over <a href = "#" target = "_blank">video</a> to know how it works.
### This app can actually help to those who practice cp on codeforces to know statistics of submissions.
### To create this app I had used <a href = "https://codeforces.com/apiHelp" target = "_blank">codeforces api's</a> to fetch the information of a particular handle.
### Tools used to create the app:
### <ol>
<li>Platform: <a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a></li><br>
<li>Backend-Lang: <a href = "https://developer.android.com/kotlin?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=CjwKCAjwy42FBhB2EiwAJY0yQs3o8U-t9sR2gml9jNy1vScWUfl2eVlwOc-3SNpPzOeMRr4txjLwhRoCfoMQAvD_BwE">Kotlin</a></li><br>
<li>Api's- <a href = "https://codeforces.com/apiHelp" target = "_blank">Codeforces API</a></li><br>
</ol>
